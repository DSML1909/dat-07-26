Project Files: 
File 1 :	GBM_Tweaking_Params : Contains tests on Tweaking tree Regression Parameters
File 2 :	Insurance_model : Contains tests on Tweaking tree Regression Parameters
File 3 :	Regression Project : Contains Bar charts
File 4 : 	Homework 3 :  Final Model file with tweaked Params for gbm, Target Encoder & One Hot Encoder

Note :  File 1-3 contains a few issues and File 4 have tweeaked values based on guess and randon numbers for parameters

The base Idea was to get the best values from Files 1-3 and plug those in the model in File 4
Looking for the following questions to be answered after the final assesment

1) was it a good idea to take the mean scores of the criteria parameter with different tree depths?
2) how to fix the error caused in the fit() method
